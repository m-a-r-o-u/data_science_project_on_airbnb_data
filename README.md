It's purpose is to teach data science fundamentals.

If you worked with it and have suggestions, please contribute your improvements.

## install

Use pip to install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The plotting library **cartopy** has external dependencies [here](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/installing.html)

# Usage

Solution scripts, can be run without any further modifications.

They contain comments questions and the solutions.

From the solution scripts, exercise scripts are generated by running:

```
python create_exercise.py --ifiles solutions*.ipynb
```

This removes lines that are tagged at the end with: `# REMOVE`

and replaces them with the placeholder `###!!! INSERT SOLUTION`.

For an examples, have a look in the first notebook.

## Git

Before staging, remove all cell output.
