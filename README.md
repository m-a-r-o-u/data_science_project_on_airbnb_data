This repo holds the notebooks to investigate the Airbnb dataset from [here](http://insideairbnb.com/)

It's purpose is to teach data science fundamentals.

# Usage

Solution scripts, can be run without any further modifications.

They contain comments questions and the solutions.

From the solution scripts, exercise scripts are generated by running:

```
python create_exercise.py --ifiles solutions*.ipynb
```

This removes lines that are tagged at the end with: `# REMOVE`

and replaces them with the placeholder `#your solution`.

For an examples, have a look in the first notebook.

## Git

Before staging, remove all cell output.
